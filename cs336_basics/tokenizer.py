    Args:
        vocab (dict[int, bytes]): The tokenizer vocabulary, a mapping from int (token ID in the vocabulary)
            to bytes (token bytes)
        merges (list[tuple[bytes, bytes]]): BPE merges. Each list item is a tuple of bytes (<token1>, <token2>),
            representing that <token1> was merged with <token2>.
            Merges are ordered by order of creation.
        special_tokens (list[str] | None): A list of string special tokens for the tokenizer. These strings will never
            be split into multiple tokens, and will always be kept as a single token.

    Returns:
        A BPE tokenizer that uses the provided vocab, merges, and special tokens.
